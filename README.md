# Superhero
A superhero hunter app created using only vanilla javascript and Bootstrap.

## Features
### 1. Home Page
   Displays list of superheroes. Each superhero list item has a favourite button and clicking on it adds it to the favourite list. There is also a search box to filter out the superheroes by their name.
   On clicking any superhero, the superhero details page is displayed.
### 2. Superhero Page
   This shows all the details of the selected superhero such as name, photo, bio, comics, series, etc.
### 3. My favourite superheroes Page
   This page displays list of all favourite superheroes. There is a remove button which removes the superhero from the favourites list. This list is persistent (even when the browser is closed and reopened the list has the same data).

Data for building this app is taken from https://developer.marvel.com.
